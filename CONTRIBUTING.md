# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Running tests

Install all dependencies before running the test suite:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The project defines a `pretest` hook so `npm install` will run automatically when you execute `npm test`, but running it explicitly ensures all packages are installed.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements.
